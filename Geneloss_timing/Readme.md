## Gene loss different groups
We ran a brach-free model using PAML with F1x4 and F3x4 codon frequency models. The folders are the groups of species where gene losses are analyzed using PAML version 4.9f. The results of this study are provided in supplementary_tables. Each folder contains the associated alignment file (either .aln or MSA.PRANK.aln.With.Names), labelled newick tree file (.nwk), and the control files (*.ctl) to run the model. All the results were obtained from various combinations plotted in a boxplot (Pseudogenization_time_compile.jpeg).

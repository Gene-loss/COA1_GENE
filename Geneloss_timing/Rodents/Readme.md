## Gene loss Rodents
Each folder and subfolder contains input and output files for rodents as foreground (non-functional gene species) under a branch-free model using PAML. 
This run aims to study the effect of different categories of species in combination (i.e. foreground and background species) for saturated and unsaturated groups based on substitution saturation results mentioned in supplementary. 
The folders contain the combinations of foreground and background species as sub-folders in the directory. 
The results of this study are provided in supplementary_tables_1.0 The PAML version 4.9f. 
Each folder contains their respective control files, which can be run with the command: "codeml control file.ctl"; where control file.ctl is the name of the control file with extension ".ctl." Here mainly two folders based on substitution saturation results. Inside these two folders, different subfolders have combinations for gene loss timing with required necessary files

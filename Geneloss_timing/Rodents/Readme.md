## Gene loss Rodents
In each folder and subfolder contains input and output files for rodents as foreground (non-functional gene species) under branch free model using PAML. 
The aim of this run is to study the effect of different categories of species in combination (i.e. foreground and background species) for saturated and unsaturated groups based on substitution saturation results mentioned in supplemnetary. 
The folders contain the combinations of foreground and background species as sub-folders in the directory. 
The script will also require an alignment file and a newick tree (labelled). 
The results of this study are provided in supplementary_tables_1.0 The PAML version 4.9f. 
Each folder contains their respective control files which can be run with the command: "codeml controlfile.ctl"; where controlfile.ctl is the name of the control file with extension ".ctl".

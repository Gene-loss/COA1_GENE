## This folder contains input and output files for Galliformes as foreground (non-functional gene species) under branch free model using PAML.
## The aim of this run is to study the effect of different categories of species in combination (i.e. foreground and background species) for estimation of pseudogenization time (Tp).
## The initial control file to run PAML is demo.ctl, which is a prerequisite to run the script. The script will also require an alignment file and a newick tree (labelled).
## The results of this study are provided in supplementary_tables_1.0
## The PAML version 4.9f.
## Each folder contains their respective control files which can be run individually also with the command: "codeml controlfile.ctl"; where controlfile.ctl is the name of the control file with extension ".ctl".
## The script requires ape and reshape2 package in R.

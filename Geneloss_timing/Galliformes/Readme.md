## Gene loss
This folder contains input and output files for Galliformes as foreground (non-functional gene species) under branch free model using PAML.
The aim of this run is to study the effect of different categories of species in combination (i.e. foreground and background species).
The script will also require an alignment file and a newick tree (labelled).
The results of this study are provided in supplementary_tables_1.0
The PAML version 4.9f.
Each folder contains their respective control files which can be run with the command: "codeml controlfile.ctl"; where controlfile.ctl is the name of the control file with extension ".ctl".

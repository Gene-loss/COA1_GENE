COA1 is a four exonic gene that pay important role in assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and complex IV. The code and data provided in this project are part of the below manuscript. The scripts and data are organised to ensure the integrity, credibility and replicability of the results reported. However, the goal of this repository is not to release a fully-automate pipeline and is beyond the scope of this manuscript. A pre-publication pre-print of the same is available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.09.447812v1.full#ref-53

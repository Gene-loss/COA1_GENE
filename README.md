# COA1
COA1 is a four exonic gene that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly. Other names include Cytochrome C Oxidase Assembly Factor 1 Homolog, C7orf44 and MITRAC15 (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex.

The code and data provided in this project are part of the below manuscript. The scripts and data are organised to ensure the integrity, credibility and replicability of the results reported. However, the goal of this repository is not to release a fully-automate pipeline and is beyond the scope of this manuscript. A pre-publication pre-print of the same is available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.09.447812v1

4.Figure5 :The Figure5 folder contains the A to F folders with bam files for the main figure 5 from different bio-project IDs of woolly mammoth available raw read data from the short read archive. We checked reads support for COA1 gene exon sequences. The output files for the GC Vs. kmer plot are from 7 different project IDs of the woolly mammoth in the G folder. Required input files and script are provided in detail.

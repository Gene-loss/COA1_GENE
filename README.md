# COA1
COA1 is a four exonic gene that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly. Other names include Cytochrome C Oxidase Assembly Factor 1 Homolog, C7orf44 and MITRAC15 (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex.

The code and data provided in this project are part of the below manuscript. The scripts and data are organised to ensure the integrity, credibility and replicability of the results reported. However, the goal of this repository is not to release a fully-automate pipeline and is beyond the scope of this manuscript. A pre-publication pre-print of the same is available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.09.447812v1

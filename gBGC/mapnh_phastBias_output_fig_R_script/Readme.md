## mapnh and phastBias results
Output from mapnh and phastBias collected in this folder for ploting. The file named by group only is comprised of the output of mapnh (column 2 = AT to GC  and 4=GC to AT),HYPHY (column 6 =dN and 8=dS),PAML (column 10 =dN and 12=dS). 
The files are named after the groups and those groups which have more number of species are splitted into many groups. These input files are merged results of mapnh(column 2 = AT to GC  and 4=GC to AT),HYPHY (column 6 =dN and 8=dS),PAML (column 10 =dN and 12=dS).
(*phastout) is output of phastBias.
For plotting code is given (gBGC.R).
In order to generate figure for each group, use Group name after R script:
(example= Rscript gBGC.R Afrotheria). 
for better visualization we split the groups.

## mapnh and phastBias results
Output from mapnh and phastBias collected in this folder for plotting. The file named by group only is comprised of the output of mapnh (column 2 = AT to GC and 4=GC to AT),HYPHY (column 6 =dN and 8=dS),PAML (column 10 =dN and 12=dS). *phastout is the output of phastBias. It contains gBGC across nucleotide positions for each species. The groups with more species in mapnh and phastBias output are divided into different sub-groups for better visualization. The files containing the group's name are used as input for plotting. For plotting, code is given (gBGC.R). example= Rscript gBGC.R Afrotheria and Rscript gBGC.R Birds_group1.

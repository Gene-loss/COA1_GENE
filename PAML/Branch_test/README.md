## Branch Test
This folder contains all branch test results. branch_test.sh was run on each folder to generate the results except in the case of duplicated gene species (folders named as speciesname_duplicated). Please refer to the script in their respective input_files folders to run branch tests in duplicated gene species. compiling_functional_result.sh is being used to compile the results of functional species, and compiling_result.sh is being used to compile the branch test results of duplicated gene species.

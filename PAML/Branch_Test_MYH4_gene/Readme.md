# MHY4 gene branch test
We checked the branch free test on MHY4 gene two groups : For first MYH4_Primate folder, we labeled the tree, the human as foreground, and the remaining primates as background (Primates_MYH4.aln)(Primates_MYH4.nwk). In second group, we labeled the primate group as foreground and the rodent group as background. The labeled tree is kept in the corresponding folder( Primates_Rodents.MYH4.nwk )(Primates_Rodents.MYH4.aln ).

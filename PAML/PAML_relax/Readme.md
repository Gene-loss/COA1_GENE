## MHY4 gene branch free tesT
We checked the branch free test on MHY4 gene two groups : For first group, we labeled the tree, the human as foreground, and the remaining primates as background (Primates_MYH4.aln)().
 In second group, we labeled the primate group as foreground and the rodent group as background. The labeled tree is kept in the corresponding folder.

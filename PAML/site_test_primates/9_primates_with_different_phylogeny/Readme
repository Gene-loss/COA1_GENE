## Site test was run using PAML 4.9f. In order to check robustness of the results and effect of different tree topologies on the results, we used one tree from timetree.org and others from a previously published paper.
## Please refer to site_model_compare_trees.sh in each folder to get the source of the tree used.	 
##Each folder contains demo control file and code file (site_model_compare_trees.sh) with detailed explanations.

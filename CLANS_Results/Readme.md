# CLANS Fig-1A
We used the human COA1 gene sequence as input in HHblits. Please refer to manuscript's materials and methods for additional details.
The output generated from HHblits is used for CLANS. CLANS gives result in a zip file (please refer to 6708313.clans).
In the CLANS figure (See figure 1A),the seven different clusters are coloured based on the groups mentioned in figure 1A.
The detailed text files of each cluster are provided in the directory ( please see TIM21_like.cluster, COA1_like.cluster, diffuse_COA1.cluster, TIM21.cluster, COA1_TIM21_hybrid.cluster, DUF1783_COAP.cluster, COA1.cluster).

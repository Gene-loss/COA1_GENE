# MHY4 gene relax test
We checked the relax test on MHY4 gene  two groups :
only_primate folder only for primate group. We labeled the tree, the human as foreground, and the remaining primates as background.
 
primate_rodent folder contains the required file for the relaxed test.  In this study, we labeled the primate group as foreground and the rodent group as background. The labeled tree is kept in the corresponding folder.

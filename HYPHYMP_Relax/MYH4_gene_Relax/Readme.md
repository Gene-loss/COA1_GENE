# MHY4 gene relax test
We checked the relax test on the MHY4 gene in two groups: We labelled the human as foreground and the remaining primates as background. All required tree files, result file alignment files are provided in the MYH4_Primate folder. In the second study, we labelled the primate group as foreground and the rodent group as background. The labelled tree and relax result is kept in the MYH4.primate_rodent folder.

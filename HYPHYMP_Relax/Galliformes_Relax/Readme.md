## Relax test for Galliformes

Different folders are represented by species labelled as foreground and five species of Anseriformes as background. In the Node_results folder, we analyzed the different nodes in Galliformes used as foreground and Galliformes and Anseriformes species as background. In the pseudogenic_species folder, we labelled four species as foreground, which became pseudogenized due to the common event of 13 bp deletion in COA1 and five Anseriformes species as background. Each folder contains a tree file downloaded from TimeTree(*nwk), alignment file (*aln), config file (*config), and result file. Code is provided (Relax_wrapper.sh).

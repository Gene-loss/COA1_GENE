## Relax test for groups

For relax test on pseudogenized copy of COA1 gene in different groups, we labelled one pseudogenized species as foreground and functional species as background. For the groups of COA1 gene, pseudogenized species are associated folders with their respective script (pseudo_script.sh). 
The list of pseudogenized species folder is as follow:

Rodents_saturated_pseudogene

Rodents_unsaturated_pseudogene_group1

Rodents_unsaturated_pseudogene_group2

Rodents_unsaturated_pseudogene_group3

Feliformia_pseudogene

Birds_pseudogene

For relax test on a functional copy of the COA1 gene in different groups, we labelled one species as foreground and the remaining functional species as background. All functional groups of COA1 gene are mentioned below with their folders, each of them contains code for relax test (relax.sh).

Afrotheria

Amphibian_Reptiles

Artiodactyla

Birds_functional

Perissodactyla

Primates_functional

Caniformia

Chiroptera

Feliformia_functional

Rodents_unsaturated_functional

For relax test on a duplicated copy of the COA1 gene in different groups, we labelled one duplicated copy as foreground (and removed the other copy of the species) and functional species as background. All duplicated groups of COA1 gene are mentioned below with their folders, and each folder contains code for relax test(duplication_relax.sh).

Feliformia_duplicate

Caniformia_duplicate

Primates_duplicate

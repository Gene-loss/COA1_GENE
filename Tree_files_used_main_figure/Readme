##For the main figures, we used species trees downloaded from the TimeTree (timetree.org).
##For galliformes, marsupials,and rodents trees were used from the TimeTree (timetree.org).
##The feliformia group Time tree showed the different split times for Acinonyx jubatus, Puma concolor, but in the previously published science article "The Late Miocene Radiation of Modern Felidae: A Genetic Assessment.". Acinonyx jubatus and Puma concolor diverged after the Felis catus; we used the tree provided in this article (Feliformia.nwk). We used the Canis lupus, and Suricata suricatta is a common outgroup downloaded from the Time tree (carnivora.nwk), and add both trees in Figure 3.

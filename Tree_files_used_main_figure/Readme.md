#   Tree used for main figure
For galliformes, marsupials, and rodents main figure, trees were downloaded from the TimeTree (timetree.org). The feliformia group on TimeTree shows the different split times for Acinonyx jubatus and Puma concolor. According to the published science article "The Late Miocene Radiation of Modern Felidae: A Genetic Assessment," Acinonyx jubatus and Puma concolor diverged after the Felis catus. We used the tree provided in this article (Feliformia.nwk). Canis lupus and Suricata suricatta are used as outgroups from the TimeTree (carnivora.nwk) and added in the species tree of Figure two. These trees (Feliformia.nwk) and (carnivora.nwk) were merged for generating Figure two. We used galliformes.nwk, rodents1.nwk, rodents2.nwk, marsupial.nwk, and fig7_raw.nwk for figure 3,4,5,6, and 7 respectively.

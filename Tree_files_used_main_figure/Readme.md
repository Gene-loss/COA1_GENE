#   Tree used for main figure
For galliformes, marsupials,and rodents main figures, trees were downloaded from the TimeTree (timetree.org).
The feliformia group on TimeTree shows different split time for Acinonyx jubatus and Puma concolor from the previously published science article "The Late Miocene Radiation of Modern Felidae: A Genetic Assessment".
According to the above-mentioned article, Acinonyx jubatus and Puma concolor diverged after the Felis catus. We used the tree provided in this article (Feliformia.nwk). Canis lupus, and Suricata suricatta are used as outgroup from the TimeTree (carnivora.nwk) and added in the species tree of Figure 3.
These trees  (Feliformia.nwk) and (carnivora.nwk)  were merged for generating the Figure 3.

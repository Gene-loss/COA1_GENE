# AlphaFold

COA1 pdb (coa1.B99990001.pdb) file was generated using modeller described in detail in materials and methods.
Another pdb (AF-Q9GZY4-F1-model_v1.pdb) file was downloaded from the AlphaFold website, where they provide the modeled structure of COA1 using the denovo method.
These pdb files were compared on the PDB website https://www.rcsb.org/alignment with option Chain ID as A and parameter as jFATCAT (rigid) for both the structures.
The result files were downloaded and are provided here.
The "a","p","m" at the end of COA1 and TIMM21 stands for "AlphaFold","RCSB PDB",and "Modelled" respectively, which means from where the respective files are derived from. e.g, COA1a_COA1m means that the pdb file of COA1 is downloaded from AlphaFold website is compared with the pdb of COA1 modelled using MODELLER.

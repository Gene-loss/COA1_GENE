# AlphaFold

COA1 pdb (coa1.B99990001.pdb) file was generated using modeller described in detail in materials and methods.
Another pdb (AF-Q9GZY4-F1-model_v1.pdb) file was downloaded from the AlphaFold website, where they provide the modeled structure of COA1 using the denovo method.
These pdb files were compared on the PDB website https://www.rcsb.org/alignment with option Chain ID as A and parameter as jFATCAT (rigid) for both the structures.
The result files were downloaded and are provided here.

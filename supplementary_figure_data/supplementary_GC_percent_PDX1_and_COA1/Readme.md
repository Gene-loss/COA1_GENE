## Calculate GC % in COA1 and PDX1 gene
As mentioned in supplementary materials and method, we used CodSeqGen window-based software to calculate the possible higher and lower GC% in both genes in two different groups species primate and rodents.
We made two txt files for two genes in which species name and possible low and high GC % from output CodSeqGen .
All species are not the same in both genes, but the number of species is the same. Similarly, for both the genes, we downloaded the species tree from TimeTree (species_coa1.nwk.txt),(species_pdx1.nwk.txt) and plotted the figure in using contmap Rsript provifed in folder(
gc.jpeg.R ).

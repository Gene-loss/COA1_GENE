## Calculate GC % in COA1 and PDX1 gene
As mentioned in the supplementary materials and method, we used CodSeqGen window-based tool to calculate the possible higher and lower GC% in COA1 and PDX1 genes in two different groups primate and rodents.
We made two files for COA1 and PDX1 genes in which species name and possible low and high GC % from output CodSeqGen (COA1_GCPERCENT.txt),(PDX1_GCPERCENT.txt).
All species are not the same in both genes, but the number of species is the same. Similarly, for both genes, we downloaded the species tree from TimeTree (species_coa1.nwk.txt),(species_pdx1.nwk.txt) and plotted the figure using Rsript provided in folder(gc.jpeg.R).

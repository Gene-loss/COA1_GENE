## Calculate GC % in COA1 and PDX1 gene
Calculate GC % in COA1 and PDX1 gene
As mentioned in the supplementary materials and method, we used CodSeqGen window-based tool to calculate the possible higher and lower GC% in COA1 and PDX1 genes in two different groups primate and rodents. We made two files for COA1 and PDX1 genes in which three columns have species names, possible low GC %, and high GC % (COA1_GCPERCENT.txt),(PDX1_GCPERCENT.txt). We kept in both gene number of species same, but few species are different. We downloaded the species tree from TimeTree (species_coa1.nwk.txt),(species_pdx1.nwk.txt)for both the genes and plotted the figure using Rsript provided in the folder(gc.jpeg.R).

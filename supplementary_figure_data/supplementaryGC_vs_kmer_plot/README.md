## GC Vs. kmer abundance plot with different species using a variety of sequencing platforms

The database fasta file is given as an input to get_GC.sh script which generates file with extension .counts. The all_gc_input.txt is taken from the supplementary table S20, where all the species' exonwise GC content was provided. This folder also contains the plotting_script.r, used to generate the figure "1final.jpeg".
